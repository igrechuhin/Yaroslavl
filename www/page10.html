                    <span class="red_line">Yaroslavl flourished in the 16th-17th centuries when new trading routes were laid down south the Volga River and local merchants became active economically and politically. Through their efforts numerous churches were built by individual merchant dynasties and communities. Yaroslavl thus got its distinctive architectural style which largely influenced architecture across Old Rus up to the reign of Peter the Great.</span><br>
                    <span class="red_line">One trading quarter church and cathedral after another (St Elijah the Prophet’s, St Nicholas’s, the Nativity of Our Lady, the Beheading of St. John the Baptist in Tolchkovo) and the Transfiguration Cathedral of the Saviour Monastery is dealt with in a separate essay. Natalia Sheredega, head of the Old Russian Art Department, Tretyakov Gallery, and Natalia Tolstaya, head of the First Publication program, the Potanin Charity Fund, take readers on a fascinating journey across 16th-17 century architecture and monumental paintings of Yaroslavl, saved from destruction by the Yaroslavl Museum Reserve.</span><br>
